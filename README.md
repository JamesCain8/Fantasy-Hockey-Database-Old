# Fantasy-Hockey-Database

Welcome to the Fantasy Hockey Database repository.  The stats in the SQL database file are updated whenever I run the database locally, meaning it will potentially be a few days behind, but no more.  To access the data, simply download the SQL file and use MYSQL to import it and run commands on it.

NOTE: AS OF DEC 10 2023, FUNCTIONALITY NO LONGER SUPPORTED
